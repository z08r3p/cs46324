where the variable to optimize is x ∈ Rn.
The matrices V1 ∈ Rp×n, V2 ∈ Rp×n, and D ∈ Rp×p are given, the matrix D being diagonal with positive entries in the diagonal:

with di > 0 for i = 1, . . . , p.

Show that the optimization problem (1) is convex.
5. Mahalanobis projection. (4 points) Consider the optimization problem

where the variable to optimize is x ∈ Rn. The vector µ ∈ Rn and the matrix Σ ∈ Rn×n are given, with Σ being symmetric and positive definite.
Show that the optimal value of problem (2) is

6. Strictly convex functions. (4 points) Suppose that the functions f1 : Rn → R and f2 : Rn → R are both convex, and let f : Rn → R be defined as f(x) = max{f1(x), f2(x)} for each x ∈ Rn. Is the function f strictly convex? If you think the answer is ‘yes’, then prove it; if you think the answer is ‘no’, then give a counter-example.
